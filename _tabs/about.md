### About Me

Hi there! I'm **Saleem Ishaq Machlovi**, a curious and passionate person who is currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science. My journey in tech started with a simple love for problem-solving and creating things, and it has grown into a deep interest in programming, technology, and innovation. I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills, learn something new, and grow as both a professional and an individual.

#### Personality

I’d describe myself as detail-oriented, with a natural inclination towards solving complex problems. I enjoy diving into challenges and finding the most efficient solutions, whether it’s a tricky coding bug or managing several projects at once. I’m someone who thrives when working with a team, but I also value my independence and time to think critically on my own.

Outside of work, I’m a big fan of outdoor activities like hiking and sports. I find that a good balance between work and play helps me recharge and stay grounded. I’m also an avid reader and enjoy novels that open my mind to new perspectives—there’s always something to learn from different viewpoints.

#### Skills

**1. Programming Languages**  
I’ve worked with a variety of programming languages and enjoy the versatility each one brings:

- **JavaScript**: I feel comfortable working with JavaScript, especially for front-end development and creating interactive web applications.
- **HTML/CSS**: I’m familiar with web design basics and love creating clean, user-friendly interfaces.
- **Java**: I’ve worked with Java at an academic level, mainly for app development and learning object-oriented programming.
- **Git**: I use Git regularly to manage my code and collaborate with others on GitHub, making version control and teamwork much easier.

**2. Web Development**  
I’ve gained hands-on experience in building web applications, particularly with **Jekyll**. I’m comfortable working with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and enjoy combining these technologies to create smooth, interactive web experiences. I’m always looking for ways to improve the user experience, both in terms of functionality and design.

**3. Problem-Solving & Logical Thinking**  
Problem-solving is one of the things I enjoy most. I’m the kind of person who loves to break down complex issues into smaller pieces and find the best solution for each one. This mindset is especially helpful when coding or debugging, and it’s something I’m constantly trying to refine.

**4. Teamwork & Collaboration**  
I believe in the power of collaboration. While I’m comfortable working independently, I know that great ideas often come from brainstorming and working with others. Whether it’s in a group project, an internship, or personal ventures, I enjoy contributing to teams and learning from different perspectives.

**5. Project Management**  
I pride myself on staying organized and keeping projects on track. I use tools like **Trello** and **GitHub Projects** to manage my tasks and ensure I meet deadlines. This helps me stay focused and ensures the work I produce is of the highest quality.

#### Areas of Improvement

Like everyone, I know there’s always room to grow. One area I’m working on is **time management**—I sometimes find it challenging to juggle multiple projects at once. I’m also diving deeper into advanced **data structures** and **algorithms** to enhance my problem-solving skills and become a better programmer overall.
